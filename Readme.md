# Contribase

## ❗ Problem Statement

In the NGO and open-source ecosystem, teams often unknowingly build **duplicate solutions** due to a lack of visibility into ongoing projects. This leads to wasted time, repeated effort, fragmented knowledge, and slower social impact.

There is no single place to:

* See what projects already exist
* Track project progress clearly
* Reuse existing solutions instead of rebuilding

---

## ✅ Solution

**NoDups** is a collaborative platform that makes open-source and NGO projects **transparent, discoverable, and reusable**.

It provides:

* A shared dashboard of ongoing projects
* Clear lifecycle stages (Idea → Prototype → Deployment)
* Reusable modules and resources

By centralizing visibility and encouraging reuse, NoDups prevents duplicate work, saves contributor time, and accelerates innovation for social impact.

**Build once. Reuse everywhere. Maximize impact.** 🌍🚀
